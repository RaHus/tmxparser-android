tmxparser-android
=================

tmxparser ported to android OS.

Cloned from http://code.google.com/p/tmx-parser

This is a library for parsing the maps generated by the Map Editor called Tiled.
The TMX format is based upon XML and may contain compressed and encoded tile data to save memory and reduce file sizes.
This parser uses the TinyXML library and its DOM interface to parse TMX files.

Here are some of the features and advantages of this library:

Conformity with the TMX specification page.
Decodes and decompresses tile data.
Can parse properties as both integers, real numbers and literals (strings).
Can parse the map file when stored in memory.
Does not rely on any graphics library.
This library uses zlib for decompression of tile layer data.
